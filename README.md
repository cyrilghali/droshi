I have asked myself first why can't draw diagrams and boom: it transform into a terraform file ?

Here I have tried to build a micro-frontend to achieve that. It take ec2 instances from aws and you can modify the name only.

Still a poc that can be pushed far further from what it is today.


EDIT 11/22:

Terraform shipped something similar
https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cloud/no-code-provisioning

I'm glad I had a close idea from their product!
